## Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Your Free Groq API Key

1. **Visit Groq Console**: Go to [https://console.groq.com/keys](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. **Sign Up/Login**: Create a free account or log in
3. **Create API Key**: Click "Create API Key" and give it a name
4. **Copy the Key**: Copy the generated API key (it starts with `gsk_`)

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment

1. **Create .env.local file**: In your project root directory, create a file named `.env.local`
2. **Add your API key**: Add this line to the file:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```
   Replace `your_actual_api_key_here` with the key you copied from Groq

### Step 3: Restart the Development Server

1. **Stop the server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in your terminal
2. **Restart**: Run `npm run dev` again
3. **Test**: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and try sending a message

## Example .env.local file

```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Please add your free Groq API key" error

- Verify the API key is correct and starts with `gsk_`
- Restart the development server after adding the key

### "Invalid API key" error
